This Python module acts as a [dnstap](https://dnstap.info/) streams receiver for DNS servers.
Input streams can be a unix, tcp or raw socket.
The output is printed directly on stdout or sent to remote tcp address 
in JSON, YAML or one line text format and more. 

If you want better performance, please to use the [dnscollector](https://github.com/dmachard/go-dnscollector) tool written in Go.

If you want to use the **dnstap** feature of your dns server, please to read the following page [Dnstap: How to enable it on main dns servers](https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/)

## Installation

### PyPI

Deploy the dnstap receiver in your DNS server with the pip command.

```python
pip install dnstap_receiver
```

After installation, you can execute the `dnstap_receiver` to start-it.

Usage:

```
usage: dnstap_receiver [-h] [-l L] [-p P] [-u U] [-v] [-c C]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -l L        IP of the dnsptap server to receive dnstap payloads (default: '0.0.0.0')
  -p P        Port the dnstap receiver is listening on (default: 6000)
  -u U        read dnstap payloads from unix socket
  -v          verbose mode
  -c C        external config file
```


### Docker Hub

Pull the dnstap receiver image from Docker Hub.

```bash
docker pull dmachard/dnstap-receiver:latest
```

Deploy the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 6000:6000 -p 8080:8080 --name=dnstap01 dmachard/dnstap-receiver
```

Add the following argument to your container if you want to provide your own [configuration](#external-config-file) file.

```bash
-v /home/dnstap.conf:/etc/dnstap_receiver/dnstap.conf
```

Follow containers logs 

```bash
docker logs dnstap01 -f
```

## Inputs handler

Severals inputs handler are supported to read incoming dnstap messages:
- [TCP socket (server)](#tcp-socket-server)
- [TCP socket (client)](#tcp-socket-client)
- [Unix socket](#unix-socket)
- [Raw socket (sniffer)](#raw-socket-sniffer)

### TCP socket (server)

The TCP socket input enable to receive dnstap messages from multiple dns servers.
This is the default input if you execute the binary without arguments.
The receiver is listening on `localhost` interface and the tcp port `6000`.
You can change binding options with `-l` and `-p` arguments.

```
./dnstap_receiver -l 0.0.0.0 -p 6000
```

You can also activate `TLS` on the socket, add the following config as external config file
to activate the tls support, configure the path of the certificate and key to use.

```yaml
input:
  tcp-socket:
    # enable tls support
    tls-support: true
    # provide certificate server path
    tls-server-cert: /etc/dnstap_receiver/server.crt
    # provide certificate key path
    tls-server-key: /etc/dnstap_receiver/server.key
```

Then execute the dnstap receiver with the configuration file:

```
./dnstap_receiver -c /etc/dnstap-receiver/dnstap.conf
```

### TCP socket (client)

The TCP socket input enable to receive dnstap messages from remote dns servers.
The communication is initiated by the dnstap receiver.

Configure this input as below

```yaml
input:
  # tcp client
  tcp-client:
    # enable or disable
    enable: true
    # retry interval in seconds to connect
    retry: 1
    # remote dns server address
    remote-address: 10.0.0.2
    # remote dns server port
    remote-port: 6000
```

### Unix socket

The unix socket input enables read dnstap message from a unix socket. 
Configure the path of the socket with the `-u` argument.

```
./dnstap_receiver -u /var/run/dnstap.sock
```

### Raw socket (sniffer)

This input enable to sniff a network interface.
Configure this input as below, you need to provide the name of your interface and associated ip.

```yaml
input:
  # sniff dns messages from network interface 
  sniffer:
    # enable or disable
    enable: true
    # interface name to sniff
    eth-name: ens18
    # ip interface to sniff
    eth-ip: [ 10.0.0.2 ]
    # dnstap identity
    dnstap-identity: sniffer
    # sniff on the list of dns port
    dns-port: [ 53 ]
    # record incoming dns client queries
    record-client-query: true
    # record outgoing dns client responses
    record-client-response: true
```

## Outputs handler

Outputs handler can be configured to forward messages in several modes.

## More options

### External config file

The `dnstap_receiver` binary can takes an external config file with the `-c` argument or searches for a config file named dnstap.conf in /etc/dnstap_receiver/.

See [config file](/dnstap_receiver/dnstap.conf) example.

```
./dnstap_receiver -c /etc/dnstap-receiver/dnstap.conf
```

### Verbose mode

You can execute the binary in verbose mode with the `-v` argument:

```
./dnstap_receiver -v
2020-11-25 20:26:59,790 DEBUG Start receiver...
2020-11-25 20:26:59,790 DEBUG Output handler: stdout
2020-11-25 20:26:59,790 DEBUG Input handler: tcp socket
2020-11-25 20:26:59,790 DEBUG Input handler: listening on 0.0.0.0:6000
2020-11-25 20:26:59,790 DEBUG Api rest: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Filtering feature

This feature can be useful if you want to ignore some messages and keep just what you want.
Several filter are available:
- by qname field
- by dnstap identity field.

#### By dnstap identity

You can filtering incoming dnstap messages according to the dnstap identity field.
A regex can be configured in the external configuration file to do that

```yaml
filter:
  # dnstap identify filtering feature with regex support
  dnstap-identities: dnsdist01|unbound01
```

#### By qname

You can filtering incoming dnstap messages according to the query name.
A regex can be configured in the external configuration file to do that

```yaml
filter: 
  # qname filtering feature with regex support
  qname-regex: ".*.com"
```

### GeoIP support

The `dnstap receiver` can be extended with GeoIP. To do that, you need to configure your own city database in binary format.

```yaml
# geoip support, can be used to get the country, and city
# according to the source ip in the dnstap message
geoip:
    # enable or disable
    enable: true
    # city database path in binary format
    city-database: /var/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
    # represent country in iso mode
    country-iso: false
```

With the GeoIP support, the following new fields will be added:
 - country
 - city

## Statistics

Some statistics are computed [on the fly](/dnstap_receiver/statistics.py) and stored in memory, you can get them: 
- directly from the [web server](#web-server) through the HTTP API.
